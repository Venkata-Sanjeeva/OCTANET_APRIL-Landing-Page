                The vegetables are usually sautéed or simmered separately to preserve their individual flavors and textures before being combined and cooked together to meld their flavors. Ratatouille can be served as a side dish, a main course, or even as a filling for omelets or sandwiches. It is often enjoyed as a vegetarian or vegan dish, but it can also accompany meat or fish dishes.
